<#
.SYNOPSIS
This script is designed to shut down all Fabric Capacities in a development subscription.

.DESCRIPTION
The script iterates through all Fabric Capacities within a specified development subscription and performs a pause operation on each unit. This is useful for managing resources and reducing costs in a development environment when the Fabric Units are not in use.

.PARAMETER SubscriptionId
The ID of the Azure subscription where the Fabric Units are located.

.NOTES
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to manage Fabric Units in the subscription.
- Verify the subscription ID and environment before running the script to avoid unintended shutdowns.
